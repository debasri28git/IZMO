what is the tag? a set of rules imposed over the user text
tag we write inside the <> like <p>--its called paragraph
paragraph characteristics will come over the data inside <p></p> tags

attribute --- comes inside the tag giving extra features for that tag it is a key value pair like thing for example height=90 for those tags who are having block characteristics we can apply this attribue to them.

some tags are having some mandate attribute like <img src="" height=90></img>




<!doctype >-- telling the browser what version of html we are using
<!doctype html>-- for html version 5

<!doctype HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">-- version 4

<!doctype html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd"> version 1
<html></html>--main tag that contains all the html tags
within html we have two section we are having in the document
1) header section
to provide extra info related to that document it is not for user to view the content except title tag we cnt see anything written inside head tag
tag name is <head></head>
related tags are->

<title>name of the page</title>-> to give title for the document
<link ></link-> at attach external css file
<link ></link-> at attach favicon file

mandate href
others rel,type
<style>->to declare css in the header section
<script>->to define javascript 
for pr
2) body section
inthe document if we want to provide heading for that we have 6 heading tags
each 
<h1><h2><h3><h4><h5><h6>
for giving heading to the page
there is no mandate attributes
when we use heading by default it will occupy total width of page and come with new line
optional attrinutes are class,id

<p> for writing a paragraph  it provides space before starting

creating different type of listing we use ol,ul,dl tags
<ol> tags for ordered list comes with number/alphabet/roman letters that we can provide in type attribute
each element we have to write in <li> tag examples---
type values can be A,a,I,i,1
<ol type="I">
<li>bike</li>
<li>car</li>
<li>bus</li>
</ol>

the same example if we want in bullet fashion we use <ul>tag
type values can be disc,circle,square

<ul type="circle">
<li>bike</li>
<li>car</li>
<li>bus</li>
</ul>

<dl>-defination list/data defination
<dt></dt>data term--->menu
<dd>item</dd>
</dl









for inserting a picture in the page the tag is <img> 
its having mandate attrribute as src--defines the source ofthe picture
other attributes are 
title--provide info in tooltip
height--set height of the pic
width-- set width of the pic
alt--is pic is not displayed then provide info about the pic
if we want a pic with caption we can use <figure></figure> tag
and <figcaption>caption</figcaption>
example

<figure>
<img src="" />
<figcaption>this is a pic</figcaption>
</figure>

to provide data in tabular manner we have
<table>
should have the following tags
mandate are <tr>->table row
<td>->table data
<caption>for table name</caption>
<th>->table heading
<thead>->header group
<tbody>->middle portion
<tfoot>->summery
table tag currently mandate attribute is border
others height width 

for merging cells rowwise or columnwise we have attribute rowspan colspan that we can apply in <th> and <td>
for grouping multiple column we use colgroup tag with <col> tag inside it that has mandate attribute span
<colgroup>
<col span="2"></col>

</colgroup>


filling up the user data
<form>->to post the data to the server
</form>

mandate attribute is action="serverpagename"
other attributes are
method=get/post
<input>->to take user value
